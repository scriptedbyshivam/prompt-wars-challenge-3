# 🌿 EcoTrace — Personal Footprint Journal

> *"The environment is where we all meet; where we all have a mutual interest; it is the one thing all of us share."* — Lady Bird Johnson

A modern personal carbon footprint tracker and sustainability journal designed for **PromptWars: Virtual — Challenge 3** by Hack2Skill × Google for Developers.

EcoTrace helps individuals **understand, track, and reduce their carbon footprint** through intuitive daily activity logging and personalized, data-driven insights — presented as a naturalist's field journal.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Dashboard
- **Carbon Rings** — a signature tree-ring circular visualization showing your footprint breakdown by category (Transport, Energy, Food, Waste) for the selected period
- **National Comparison** — your footprint benchmarked against India's estimated average (~1.9 tons CO₂e/month)
- **Dynamic summary sentence** — auto-generated insight based on your actual logged data
- Weekly / Monthly toggle

### 📝 Log Activity
- **Transport** — 9 travel modes (Petrol Car, Diesel Car, EV, Bus, Train/Metro, Two-Wheeler, Domestic Flight, International Flight, Bicycle, Walking) with distance in km
- **Energy** — electricity (kWh) and LPG cylinder usage (with built-in Household Size and AC Usage quick estimate assistants)
- **Diet** — 5 daily diet patterns (Vegan → Non-veg Heavy) with per-day emission factors
- **Waste** — volume level (Low/Medium/High) × segregation status (Yes/No)
- All inputs validated with Zod — friendly inline errors, never a crash

### 💡 Personal Insights
- Rules-based recommendation engine (deterministic TypeScript — fully unit-tested)
- Identifies your highest-impact category from real logged data
- 3–5 actionable recommendations ranked by estimated CO₂ savings (kg CO₂e/week)
- Recomputes dynamically with every new entry
- 4–5 rules per category covering all four activity types

### 📈 History & Trends
- Area/line chart (Recharts) showing daily emissions over time
- Per-category stacked view toggle
- Data ledger listing every logged entry with delete option

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/scriptedbyshivam/prompt-wars-challenge-3.git
cd prompt-wars-challenge-3

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist/` folder is a fully static site — deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages with no server required.

### Preview Production Build Locally

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm run test:watch
```

### What's Tested

- **`calculations.ts`** — unit tests for every emission calculation function (transport, energy, diet, waste, total aggregator), covering normal cases, zero/empty input, and boundary values
- **`insights.ts`** — unit tests for the recommendation engine: ranking by impact, per-category rule firing, edge cases with no data
- **Component tests** — ActivityLog form (valid submission + validation errors), Dashboard (correct totals from mock data), Insights panel (recommendations sorted by savings)

All tests must pass before submission — no skipped or failing tests in the build.

## 🌍 Emission Factor Assumptions

All factors are approximate and intended for **personal awareness only** — not regulatory reporting. Sourced from publicly available datasets for India.

### Transport (kg CO₂e per km)
| Mode | Factor |
|------|--------|
| Petrol Car | 0.192 |
| Diesel Car | 0.171 |
| Electric Car (India grid avg) | 0.085 |
| Two-Wheeler | 0.072 |
| Bus | 0.105 |
| Train / Metro | 0.041 |
| Domestic Flight | 0.255 |
| International Flight | 0.195 |
| Bicycle / Walking | 0.000 |

### Energy
| Source | Factor |
|--------|--------|
| Electricity (India grid avg) | 0.71 kg CO₂e / kWh |
| LPG cylinder (14.2 kg domestic) | 42 kg CO₂e / refill |

### Diet (kg CO₂e per day)
| Pattern | Factor |
|---------|--------|
| Vegan | 1.5 |
| Vegetarian | 1.7 |
| Eggetarian | 2.1 |
| Non-veg (moderate) | 3.3 |
| Non-veg (heavy) | 5.6 |

### Waste (kg CO₂e per day)
| Volume | Segregated | Mixed |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Low | 0.5 | 0.9 |
| Medium | 1.0 | 1.8 |
| High | 1.6 | 2.9 |

**National Average Baseline:** ~1.9 tons CO₂e/month (~438 kg CO₂e/week) — estimated per capita for India. Cited visibly in the UI as an estimate.

> All emission factors are defined in `src/data/emissionFactors.ts` as a single documented constants module.

## ♿ Accessibility

EcoTrace is built to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards:

- Semantic HTML throughout (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, correct heading hierarchy)
- All form inputs have associated `<label>` elements — not just placeholders
- The tree-ring chart has a text/table alternative accessible via `aria-describedby`
- Visible focus states on every interactive element
- Color contrast checked for all palette combinations against the paper background
- Full keyboard navigation — every control reachable and operable without a mouse
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected — no looping animations
- Skip-to-content link for the navigation rail
- Badge locked/earned status communicated via text ("Locked" / "Earned on [date]"), not color alone

## 🔒 Security & Quality Engineering

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for full details. Key safeguards implemented in the application:

- **Input Sanitization & Coercion**: Built with Zod to intercept NaN/Infinity values, strip leading/trailing spaces, and enforce reasonable limits on all entries (e.g. max distance of 1000 km/day).
- **Secure Persistence Layer**:
  - **Storage Bounds**: Restricts storage usage to 4MB max to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) through disk filling.
  - **Data Schema Verification**: Automatically verifies the version of stored data (`1.0.0`) and sanitizes data against strict Zod parsing rules on both reads and writes.
  - **Rate Limiting**: Throws validation errors if users attempt to register more than 50 entries for a single date, preventing memory consumption attacks.
- **Render Crash Protection**: Wrap-around `<ErrorBoundary>` catches component lifecycle errors (such as Recharts size glitches) and mounts a fallback layout without stopping the host app.
- **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Includes standard CSP tags in `index.html` enforcing origin control on styles, scripts, fonts, and data connections.
- **Modular Refactoring**: All logging subforms are extracted into single-purpose components to improve code quality, readability, and testing boundaries.
